<h2>ðŸ’»Project:</h2>
<p>This project is a game, thought by Alura, in which the user must guess the number created by a function that generates random numbers from 0 to 100. When he loses the game, he counts the amount of attempts that this player had. When you win, a message will appear saying you won the game.</p>
